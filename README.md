📘 Employee Tracker System

This application provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee records. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete employee details, including designations and joining dates. Built with Java (Spring Boot) for the backend and React.js for the frontend, the system uses MySQL as the database. It offers real-time updates and an intuitive UI for efficient employee data management.
